# Strict Email Login
Allow only the user to login only with email, a Open Source Social Network component. It is a modified component by lianglee (structural, ossn_com.php file) but the actions code are a modified OSSN v7.0. The ossn_com.xml was based on the information on OSSN's website.

### Note on the OSSN version requirement
It is possible to install this on older versions of OSSN, but I cannot gurantee that as I have not reviewed the code of those versions.

If you are brave to try on older versions of OSSN, feel free to change the ossn_com.xml file's requirement lower.
